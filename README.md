# Xception-from-scratch : 

1 / What is Xception?

Another variant of the GoogLeNet architecture is also worth noting: Xception was proposed in 2016 by Fran√ßois Chollet (the author of Keras) and it significantly outperformed Inception-v3 on a huge vision task (350 million images and 17,000 classes). Just like Inception-v4, it also merges the ideas of GoogLeNet and ResNet, but it replaces the inception modules with a special type of layer called a depthwise separable convolution (or separable convolution for short ). These layers had been used before in some CNN architectures (MobileNets), but they were not as central as in the Xception architecture.
